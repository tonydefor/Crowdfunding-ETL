# Crowdfunding-ETL

## Overview

In this Challenge, we used Python, Pandas, and Jupyter notebooks to do the extract and transform phases. Specifically, we extracted and transformed the backers’ contact information from a CSV file to create a DataFrame that will be exported as a CSV file.  Then, completed load phase. Specifically, we used the dataset to create an ERD and a table schema for creating a new table in the crowdfunding_db database. We then uploaded the CSV file that contains the backers’ information into this table. Finally, performed a data analysis on the crowdfunding_db database by using SQL queries.
